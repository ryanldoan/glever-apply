# Glever Apply — Job Application Autofill

Glever Apply is a Chrome extension that autofills job applications on Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, and Rippling. It remembers answers per application and builds a reusable bank of responses over time, so you spend less time typing and more time applying.

It pairs well with https://glever.co/, a job board that sources roles directly from Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workable, and Rippling. Discover openings on Glever.co and use Glever Apply to quickly autofill when you click through to apply on the ATS.

## How It Works

- Saves answers per application: Builds a growing bank of responses as you apply.
- Context-aware autofill: Maps your saved answers to each platform’s fields.
- Light footprint: Quick Autofill provides a minimal, on-page UI; Expanded view gives full control when you need it.

2. Enable Developer Mode (top-right toggle).
3. Click “Load unpacked” and select the project’s `dist` or project root (depending on your build).

## Tips

- Use Quick Autofill for fast, minimal UI filling.

## Privacy
